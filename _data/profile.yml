    👋Hi, guys! I'm Siqi Fu, currently a third-year graduate student at Yantai University, majoring in Computer Technology under the guidance of 
    Prof. <a href="https://drpengsong.github.io/" target="_blank">Peng Song</a>. 
    Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Digital Media Technology from Tianjin Foreign Studies University.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current research focuses on speech emotion recognition (SER) and multimodal emotion recognition (MER). I'm also interested in 
    multi-view learning and EEG-based emotion recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of academics, I love movies🎞️, music🎵, and participating in various sports🏃‍♀️~
  </p>
