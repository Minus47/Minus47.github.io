  We present a novel common discriminative latent space learning (CDLSL) method for cross-domain SER. To be specific, we first obtain a common latent space by imposing a projection matrix on the cross-domain data. Meanwhile, we impose an uncorrelated constraint on the projection matrix to ensure that the features are representative and discriminative after dimension reduction. Then, we implement a graph regularization term on the latent representations of the samples to capture the local similarity information. Furthermore, to obtain a more discriminative common latent space, we introduce the label information by aligning the latent space with the relaxed label space, while mitigating the information loss for regression.
